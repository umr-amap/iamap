.. note::
   
   - Most deep learning backbone supports only images up to three-band, however in iamap we adapt them to be able to process more bands. Please note that this adaptation does not imply re-training and as such you may generate bad quality features when using more than 3 spectral bands.
   - The iamap plugin is currently in active development. We will continue making improvements and welcome your feedback. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or discussion on our GitHub repository at `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/ptresson/iamap/issues>`_ .
