# Common issues

## Similarity or Random Forest causes QGIS to crash

This crash is due to a bug during `geopandas` reading of a shapefile, only when it has allready read a shapefile. It is probably linked to `fiona` as well. If you have any idea on how to solve this, please do participate in the [corresponding issue](https://github.com/umr-amap/iamap/issues/28).

Meanwhile, if QGIS crashes and your file were not saved, you can still find them in the temp files like `/tmp/iamap_features` for instance.



## QGIS crashes at the start of encoding

This issue should be solved but the solution has not been tested on all OSes. This is an issue with `rtree` during the creation of the dataset that will be used by the plugin.
Indeed, depending on the installation, `rtree` and QGIS may have conflicting `libspatialindex`. Currently, there is several solutions:

### 1. Uninstall `rtree` installed via pip and reinstall via package manager

in the QGIS python console:

(following code has not been tested, based on this [SE answer](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/418274/installing-python-module-using-pip-via-python-console-in-qgis-3-22))
```
import subprocess 
import sys

if sys.platform == 'win32':
    subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '/python', "-m", 'pip', 'unininstall', 'rtree'])
else:
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', 'rtree']) 
```

then in a terminal (for a debian based linux)

```
sudo apt-get install python3-rtree
```

### 2. Uninstall `rtree` installed via pip and reinstall `rtree` at an older version (<1.0.0)

in the QGIS python console:

(following code has not been tested, based on this [SE answer](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/418274/installing-python-module-using-pip-via-python-console-in-qgis-3-22))
```
import subprocess 
import sys

if sys.platform == 'win32':
    subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '/python', "-m", 'pip', 'unininstall', 'rtree'])
    subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '/python', "-m", 'pip', 'install', 'rtree==0.9'])
else:
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', 'rtree']) 
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, "-m", 'pip', 'install', 'rtree==0.9'])
```

### 3. Use a conda environement.

This way, rtree and qgis will automatically share the same libspatialindex.

## `libspatialindex` error with geopandas

On a fresh install, geopandas might not find the correct `libspatialindex`, then as for the previous error, you can install the `libspatialindex` on your system via

```
sudo apt-get install python3-rtree
```


## UMAP crashes


If you're using Windows, the use of UMAP may cause the plug-in to crash QGIS when using it.
If this issue happens we recommend to go in the algo.py file of this plug in and comment the line :Â²

```
import umap
```

Then save the change, reload the plug-in and try again.


## Major tilling efects

After encoding, it is common to see tilling effect, however, sometimes, these effects are overwhelming (for instance if you can only see a color gradient on every tile and no local features).
The issue might be a normalization issue, with every tile fed to the network being wrongfully normalized.
The root of the problem may be the meta-data of your raster, check that the `STATISTICS_MEAN` and `STATISTICS_STDDEV` are correct, because these are the ones used by the plugin if they exist.

The following command could potentially solve meta-data issues.

```
gdal_edit.py -stats your_file.tif
```

## Conflicting requirements for UMAP

`umap` has `numba` as a dependdencie, which may require `numpy < 2.0` and conflict with other librairies depending on how you installed them. According to `numba` developpers, this
[should be resolved in comming numba releases](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/9708).
In the mean time, you can use a conda environement or uninstall and reinstall numpy at a previous version.

## Rasterio error after 499 batches in Windows

You can encounter an error like the following:

```
rasterio._err.CPLE_AppDefinedError: Deleting C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\iamap_features\9e156c7bae06cfb63493fc0f4a0f8225\merged_tmp.tif failed: Permission denied
```

The encoding algorithm merges temporary files periodically (by default 500). Afterwards it cleanes the old temp files to leave space. 
This error is because you probably have deleting rights in the default temporary folder. Try to choose an other folder or to get in touch with your IT support.
